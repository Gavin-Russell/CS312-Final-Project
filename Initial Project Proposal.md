# Initial Project Proposal

## Introduction
The goal of this group project is to learn the proper usage of React and NodeJS in full stack web development. To facilitate this we will be designing and implementing a blog post website as described below.

We will be developing our proposed project in the Github repository located at https://github.com/Gavin-Russell/CS312-Final-Project.

## Project Proposal
Our CS 312 project needed to meet a certain set of requirements. Specifically, it has to include most if not all topics we will cover within the class. This includes class/functional components, handler functions, child components, lists, forms, HTTP requests, Node.js functionality, and possibly a MongoDB database. To cover every topic, our team has decided to create a blog post website. The website will host a facebook style list of blog posts in the order of when they were posted. Each blog post will contain the user's name who posted it, a title and a description. Users will be able to connect to the website and create and add a blog post to the list without having to log in. The posts will delete themselves after a set number of hours. This idea certainly covers every topic needed. If this project were to expand into a commercial application, its audience would be teens to adults, as people of that demographic already use social media of this style. 

## Project Plan
In order to ensure our project is successfully completed we will begin development on the front end of the website before we have reached the NodeJS portion of the course content. Specifically we will lay out a template look and feel for using the front end of the webpage. The other primary milestones to complete before server side development has been initiated is to create a component that will render a blog post and a component to intake a new blog post from a user. Intaking a new blog post from a user will be its own separate post but the rest will be a single page site.
Completing the first three objectives mentioned above by the end of Week 6 will allow us to focus on the server. Our primary focus will turn to storing blog posts on the server and removing them at appropriate time intervals. We will also implement a component in React that can get a list of posts from the server and implement each one using the single post component made previously. The component that intakes new blog posts will also need to be updated to store the input information on the server.
We anticipate the second half of development will be completed during Week 9 of the course. This will leave the last week free for debugging and building/rehearsing for our final presentation.
