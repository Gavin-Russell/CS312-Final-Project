# Project Idea Summary
Our project is creating a blog hosting website. The website will feature blog posts from many different users about multiple topics. Blogs will be viewable and writable by all users. The blogs will be stored in a list on the server, and will be viewable for 4 hours, before being deleted, showing only the latest activity on the site. Users will have the ability to see blogs of all topic types as well as writing new blog posts to the server for all users to see.

# Project Plan
The development of this project will be split into two phases. Phase 1, which will be one week in length, will focus on creating the front end of the website, as well as some select back end functionality. Most of the front end components we need will be created, including things like the nav bar, a blog post placeholder component, a login and signup page and a user profile page. However, the login and sign up backend functionality will be implemented. This will mean each user can make an account and set their account details. By extension, this also includes setting up the database so the login data can be stored, however, it will be implemented differently than in Phase 2. This is because we do not have a server file yet to have HTTP requests retrieve and access the database, so all database interactions will be done on the react server for now. All CSS for each component created will be made as well. Ian will be mainly focusing on the CSS and navigational components, Jacob will be focusing on creating the main page components and Gavin will be focusing on implementing the sign in and sign up actions, as well as setting up the database. While these are everyonesâ€™ main focus, everyone will have a part in doing everything. At the end of this phase, a skeleton website will be created, including a nav bar, fake blog posts, and a functional sign up and sign in page, along with working user accounts. 

For Phase 2 of development, which is also a week long, we will be implementing the server file. This includes adding all endpoints and routes for HTTP requests from the react server and adding blog post functionality for the database. Functionality for the blog posts will also be added. This includes having each user create and edit blog posts, add comments, and like or dislike posts. Filtering for blog posts will also be added. For work allotments, Ian and Jacob will be implementing component functionality, and Gavin will be implementing the server page. Again, while these are the main tasks for everyone to focus on, everyone will help to create everything. Overall, the project will be finished by the end of phase 2, including functional blog posting, commenting, liking and disliking, filtering, and fully functional user profiles.
