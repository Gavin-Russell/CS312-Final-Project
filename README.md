# Project Idea Summary
Our project is creating a blog hosting website. The website will feature blog posts from many different users about multiple topics. Blogs will be viewable and writable by topic. The blogs will be stored in a list on the server, and will be viewable for 4 hours, before being deleted, showing only the latest activity on the site. Users will have the ability to filter blogs by a certain topic type as well as writing new blog posts to the server for all users to see.

# Project Plan
Our team plans to build an initial template webpage to use across the site first, then move on to create a basic component to render a blog post. From there we will expand to rendering lists of blogs. Once when that is complete, we will create the backend to store the blog post data. This will also involve creating frontend functions to get and put blog posts and post lists from the server to create web pages as well as creating new posts.
